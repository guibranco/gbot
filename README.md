## Commands

That's what I can do :neckbeard::
- `@gstraccini help`: Shows the help message with available commands.
- `@gstraccini hello`: Says hello to the invoker.
- `@gstraccini thank you`: Replies with you are welcome message to the invoker.

	- `type`: `[required]` Specifies if it should trigger a build in a `commit` or `pull request`.
- `@gstraccini bump version <version> <project>`: Bumps the [.NET version](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core) in .csproj files. :warning: (in development - maybe not working as expected!)
	- `version`: `[required]` The .NET version
	- `project`: `[optional]` The `.csproj` file to update. Suppressing this parameter will run the command in all `.csproj` in the repository/branch.
- `@gstraccini change runner <runner> <workflow> <jobs>`: Changes the [GitHub action runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources) in a workflow file (.yml). :warning: (in development - maybe not working as expected!)

- `@gstraccini prettier`: Formats the code using [Prettier](https://prettier.io).
- `@gstraccini review`: Enable review for the target pull request. This is useful when the PR submitter wasn't on the watch list, the webhook was not captured, or some failed scenario occurred.
- `@gstraccini track`: Tracks the specified pull request. Queue a build, raise a **[dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) recreate** comment to resolve conflicts, and synchronize merge branches. :warning: (in development - maybe not working as expected!)

Multiple commands can be issued at the same time. Just respect each command pattern (with bot name prefix + command).

## How it works

This project is just part of the overall process.
Currently, there is another (still private) repository that works with this one to provide all the necessary data and metadata for the actions.

### Webhooks

Once you install the [GStraccini-bot GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/gstraccini), GitHub will start sending some webhooks to a registered endpoint for some events. Once these webhooks reach the handler, they will be stored in SQL database tables to be processed later by this bot.

If you are interested in hosting your own instance, let me know, and I will share with you the database schemas and scripts and the procedure to create your own GitHub app to receive the events on your infrastructure.

### Cronjobs

The bot handlers on this repository run on my own infrastructure with the following intervals:

- comments: every 1 minute
- issues: every 1 minute
- pull requests: every 1 minute
- webhook signature: every 5 minutes
