## How it works

This project is just part of the overall process.
Currently, another (still private) repository works with this one to provide all the necessary data and metadata for the actions.

---

### Webhooks

Once you install the [GStraccini-bot GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/gstraccini), GitHub will send webhooks to a registered endpoint for some events. Once these webhooks reach the handler, they are stored in SQL database tables for later processing by this bot.

If you are interested in hosting your instance, let me know, and I will share the database schemas and scripts and the procedure for creating your own GitHub app to receive events on your infrastructure.
