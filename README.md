- `@gstraccini hello`: Says hello to the invoker.
- `@gstraccini thank you`: Replies with you are welcome message to the invoker.
- `@gstraccini bump version <version> <project>`: Bumps the .NET version in .csproj files.
  - `version`: `[required]` The .NET version
  - `project`: `[optional]` The .csproj file to update. Suppressing this parameter will run the command in all .csproj in the repository/branch

  - `runner`: `[required]` The runner's name
  - `workflow`: `[required]` The workflow filename (with or without the .yml/.yaml extension)
  - `jobs`: `[optional]` The job's to apply this command. Suppressing this parameter will run the command in all jobs within the workflow

- `@gstraccini fix csproj`: Fixes the csproj file with packages.config version of NuGet packages (only for **.NET Framework** projects).
- `@gstraccini review`: Enable review for the target pull request. This is useful when the PR submitter wasn't on the watch list before, the webhook was not captured, or some failed scenario occurred.
- `@gstraccini track`: Tracks the specified pull request. Queue a build, raise **[dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot), recreate** comment to resolve conflicts, and synchronize merge branches.

Multiple commands can be issued at the same time. Just respect each command pattern (with bot name prefix + command).

> The allowed invokers are configurable via the `config.json` file.

## How it works

This project is just part of the overall process.
Currently, there is another (still private) repository that works with this one to provide all the necessary data and metadata for the actions.

### Webhooks

Once you install the [GStraccini-bot GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/gstraccini), GitHub will start sending some webhooks to a registered endpoint for some events. Once these webhooks reach the handler, they will be stored in SQL database tables to be processed later by this bot.

If you are interested in hosting your own instance, let me know, and I will share with you the database schemas and scripts and the procedure to create your own GitHub app to receive the events on your infrastructure.

### Cronjobs

The bot handlers on this repository run on my own infrastructure with the following intervals:

- comments: every 1 minute
- issues: every 1 minute
- pull requests: every 1 minute
- webhook signature: every 5 minutes
